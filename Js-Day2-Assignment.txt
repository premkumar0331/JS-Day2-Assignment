   engine in different browsers EX: V8 engine in Chrome Browser,			browser independently without the Browsers.
   Spider Monkey engine in FireFox etc  
2. JS is used on Client side                    			        ----    NodeJS used on server side.

   for writing scripts on the website.                


Q2. watch & summary 5 points - 

Ans:      i) HTML is forgiving by nature , parsing is not straight forward and can be halted .
	 ii) <script> will halt the parser as it can alter the document, <link> and <style> could halt the JS execution. <script> should be at the bottom 	     for uninterrupted parsing, faster to render.
	iii) Parse our CSS and HTML to create a DOM tree. DOM tree then gets converted into a render tree, it has four trees, the layers, the line boxes, the render 		     objects and the render styles.
	 iv) layout is a process where it computes the elements appear on the page, based on its relationship with the other elements
	  v) painting will actually produce an image of that layer give you as the visual output.

	c) typeof('1.1')  	-----> // 'string'

	d) typeof(true)   	-----> // 'boolean'

	e) typeof(null)   	-----> // 'object'

	f) typeof(undefined)    -----> // 'undefined'

	g) typeof([]) 		-----> // 'object'

	h) typeof({}) 		-----> // 'object'

	i) typeof(NaN) 		-----> // 'number'
